# Terms of Service
Please read the Macaron Bleu bot terms of service carefully so that there are no problems in the future. <br>
By adding the bot to your server, you have automatically agreed to the terms of service.
If you do not agree to the terms, you are not allowed to use the service

## Usefulness, mistakes and unforeseen events
When using the bot, errors and incompleteness can occur. We are constantly updating the bot
to deliver the best user experience and server performance, however, if there are any errors or incomplete information we cannot be held responsible.

If you notice something strange or an error in the bot, I kindly ask you to log into the <a href="https://discord.gg/c48kj4mXgp">support server</a>
 and report the error with a photo and explanation of what happened.

## Forbidden
If there is an attempt to take down the bot, attacks, malicious use or any other action that harms
the bot and its image, the user will be subject to just cause proceedings and banned indefinitely from using the bot's services.

**Serious cases will not be appealed.**

## Responsible use
By using the service, you admit your own risks in the event of bot integrity

## Publicity

The bot can make small commercial or non-commercial announcements, for example: support server, premium, etc., but in a moderate way
that doesn't affect your server. Be aware that these advertisements will not be removed from the bot in order for your services to gain more visibility.

## Changes
By continuing to access or use our Service you agree to be bound by the revised terms. 
If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the Service.
